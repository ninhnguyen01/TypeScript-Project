Chapter 2. The Type System
    JavaScript’s power
    Comes from flexibility
    Be careful with that!
I talked briefly in Chapter 1, “From JavaScript to TypeScript” about the existence of a “type checker” in TypeScript that looks at your code, understands how it’s meant to work, and lets you know where you might have messed up. But how does a type checker work, really?

What’s in a Type?
A “type” is a description of what a JavaScript value shape might be. By “shape” I mean which properties and methods exist on a value, and what the built-in typeof operator would describe it as.

For example, when you create a variable with the initial value "Aretha":

let singer = "Aretha";

TypeScript can infer, or figure out, that the singer variable is of type string.

The most basic types in TypeScript correspond to the seven basic kinds of primitives in JavaScript:
    null
    undefined
    boolean // true or false
    string // "", "Hi!", "abc123", …​
    number // 0, 2.1, -4, …​
    bigint // 0n, 2n, -4n, …​
    symbol // Symbol(), Symbol("hi"), …​

For each of these values, TypeScript understands the type of the value to be one of the seven basic primitives:
    null; // null
    undefined; // undefined
    true; // boolean
    "Louise"; // string
    1337; // number
    1337n; // bigint
    Symbol("Franklin"); // symbol

If you ever forget the name of a primitive, you can type a let variable with a primitive value into the TypeScript Playground or an IDE and hover your mouse over the variable’s name. The resultant popover will include the name of the primitive.

TypeScript is also smart enough to be able to infer the type of a variable whose starting value is computed. In this example, TypeScript knows that the ternary expression always results in a string, so the bestSong variable is a string:

// Inferred type: string
let bestSong = Math.random() > 0.5
  ? "Chain of Fools"
  : "Respect";

Back in the TypeScript Playground or your IDE, try hovering your cursor on that bestSong variable. You should see some info box or message telling you that TypeScript has inferred the bestSong variable to be type string.
TypeScript reporting a 'let' variable as being its string literal type from its ternary expression.

Note

Recall the differences between objects and primitives in JavaScript: classes such as Boolean and Number wrap around their primitive equivalents. TypeScript best practice is generally to refer to the lower-case names, such as boolean and number, respectively.

Type Systems
A type system is the set of rules for how a programming language understands what types the constructs in a program may have.

At its core, TypeScript’s type system works by:
    Reading in your code and understanding all the types and values in existence
    For each value, seeing what type its initial declaration indicates it may contain
    For each value, seeing all the ways it’s used later on in code
    Complaining to the user if a value’s usage doesn’t match with its type

Let’s walk through this type inference process in detail.

Take the following snippet, in which TypeScript is emitting a type error about a member property being erroneously called as a function:

let firstName = "Whitney";
firstName.length();
//        ~~~~~~
//  This expression is not callable.
//    Type 'Number' has no call signatures.

TypeScript came to that complaint by, in order:
    Reading in the code and understanding there to be a variable named firstName
    Concluding that firstName is of type string because its initial value is a string, "Whitney"
    Seeing that the code is trying to access a .length member of firstName and call it like a function
    Complaining that the .length member of a string is a number, not a function (it can’t be called like a function)

Understanding TypeScript’s type system is an important skill for understanding TypeScript code. Code snippets in this chapter and throughout the rest of this book will display more and more complex types that TypeScript will be able to infer from code.

Kinds of Errors
While writing TypeScript, the two kinds of “errors” you’ll come across most frequently are:
Syntax
    Blocking TypeScript from being converted to JavaScript
Type
    Something mismatched has been detected by the type checker

The differences between the two are important.

Syntax errors
Syntax errors are when TypeScript detects incorrect syntax that it cannot understand as code. These block TypeScript from being able to properly generate output JavaScript from your file. Depending on the tooling and settings you’re using to convert your TypeScript code to JavaScript, you might still get some kind of JavaScript output (in default tsc settings, you will). But if you do, it likely won’t look like what you expect.

This input TypeScript has a syntax error for an unexpected let:

let let wat;
//      ~~~
// Error: ',' expected.

Its compiled JavaScript output, depending on the TypeScript compiler version, may look something like:

let let, wat;

Tip
Although TypeScript will do its best to output JavaScript code regardless of syntax errors, the output code will likely not be what you wanted. It’s best to fix syntax errors before attempting to run the output JavaScript.

Type errors
Type errors occur when your syntax is valid but the TypeScript type checker has detected an error with the program’s types. These do not block TypeScript syntax from being converted to JavaScript. They do, however, often indicate something will crash or behave unexpectedly if your code is allowed to run.

You saw this in Chapter 1, “From JavaScript to TypeScript” with the console.blub example, where the code was syntactically valid but TypeScript could detect it would likely crash when run:

console.blub("Nothing is worth more than laughter.");
//      ~~~~
// Error: Property 'blub' does not exist on type 'Console'.

Even though TypeScript may output JavaScript code despite the presence of type errors, type errors are generally a sign that the output JavaScript likely won’t run the way you wanted. It’s best to read them and consider fixing any reported issues before running JavaScript.

Note
Some projects are configured to block running code during development until all TypeScript type errors — not just syntax are fixed. Many developers, myself included, generally find this to be annoying and unnecessary. Most projects have a way to not be blocked, such as with the tsconfig.json file and configuration options covered in Chapter 13, “Configuration Options”.

Assignability
TypeScript reads variables’ initial values to determine what type those variables are allowed to be. If it later sees an assignment of a new value to that variable, it will check if that new value’s type is the same as the variable’s.

TypeScript is fine with later assigning a different value of the same type to a variable. If a variable is, say, initially a string value, later assigning it another string would be fine:

let firstName = "Carole";
firstName = "Joan";

If TypeScript sees an assignment of a different type, it will give us a type error. We couldn’t, say, initially declare a variable with a string value and then later on put in a boolean:

let lastName = "King";
lastName = true;
// Error: Type 'boolean' is not assignable to type 'string'.

TypeScript’s checking of whether a value is allowed to be provided to a function call or variable is called assignability: whether that value is assignable to the expected type it’s passed to. This will be an important term in later chapters as we compare more complex objects.

Understanding Assignability Errors
Errors in the format “Type…​is not assignable to type…​” will be some of the most common types of errors you’ll see when writing TypeScript code.

The first type mentioned in that error message is the value the code is attempting to assign to a recipient. The second type mentioned is the recipient being assigned the first type. For example, when we wrote lastName = true in the previous snippet, we were trying to assign the value of true — type boolean — to the recipient variable lastName — type string.

You’ll see more and more complex assignability issues as you progress through this book. Remember to read them carefully to understand reported differences between actual and expected types. Doing so will make it much easier to work with TypeScript when it’s giving you grief over type errors.

Type Annotations
Sometimes a variable doesn’t have an initial value for TypeScript to read. TypeScript won’t attempt to figure out the initial type of the variable from later uses. It’ll consider the variable by default to be implicitly the any type: indicating that it could be anything in the world.

Variables that can’t have their initial type inferred go through what’s called an evolving any: rather than enforce any particular type, TypeScript will evolve its understanding of the variable’s type each time a new value is assigned.

Here, assigning the evolving any variable rocker is first assigned a string, which means it has string methods such as toUpperCase, but then is evolved into a number:

let rocker; // Type: any

rocker = "Joan Jett"; // Type: string
rocker.toUpperCase(); // Ok

rocker = 19.58; // Type: number
rocker.toPrecision(1); // Ok

rocker.toUpperCase();
//     ~~~~~~~~~~~
// Error: 'toUpperCase' does not exist on type 'number'.

TypeScript was able to catch that we were calling the toUpperCase() method on a variable evolved to type number. However, it wasn’t able to tell us earlier whether it was intentional that we were evolving the variable from string to number in the first place.

Allowing variables to be evolving any typed and using the any type in general partially defeats the purpose of TypeScript’s type checking! TypeScript works best when it knows what types your values are meant to be. Much of TypeScript’s type checking can’t be applied to any typed values because they don’t have known types to be checked. Chapter 13, “Configuration Options” will cover how to configure TypeScript’s implicit any complaints.

TypeScript provides a syntax for declaring the type of a variable without having to assign it an initial value, called a type annotation. A type annotation is placed after the name of a variable and includes a colon followed by the name of a type.

This type annotation indicates the rocker variable is meant to be type string:

let rocker: string;
rocker = "Joan Jett";

These type annotations exist only for TypeScript they don’t affect the runtime code and are not valid JavaScript syntax. If you run tsc to compile TypeScript source code to JavaScript, they’ll be erased. For example, the previous example would be compiled to roughly the following JavaScript:

// output .js file
let rocker;
rocker = "Joan Jett";

Assigning a value whose type is not assignable to the variable’s annotated type will cause a type error.

This snippet assigns a number to a rocker variable previously declared as type string, causing a type error:

let rocker: string;
rocker = 19.58;
// Error: Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'.

You’ll see through the next few chapters how type annotations allow you to augment TypeScript’s insights into your code, allowing it to give you better features during development. TypeScript contains an assortment of new pieces of syntax, such as these type annotations that exist only in the type system.

Note
Nothing that exists only in the type system gets copied over into emitted JavaScript. TypeScript types don’t affect emitted JavaScript.

Unnecessary Type Annotations
Type annotations allow us to provide information to TypeScript that it wouldn’t have been able to glean on its own. You could also use them on variables that have immediately inferable types, but you wouldn’t be telling TypeScript anything it doesn’t already know.

The following : string type annotation is redundant because TypeScript could already infer that firstName be of type string:

let firstName: string = "Tina";
//           ~~~~~~~~ Does not change the type system...

If you do add a type annotation to a variable with an initial value, TypeScript will check that it matches the type of the variable’s value.

The following firstName is declared to be of type string, but its initializer is the number 42, which TypeScript sees as an incompatibility:

let firstName: string = 42;
//  ~~~~~~~~~
// Error: Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'.

Many developers myself included generally prefer not to add type annotations on variables where the type annotations wouldn’t change anything. Having to manually write out type annotations can be cumbersome especially when they change, and for the complex types I’ll show you later in this book.

It can sometimes be useful to include explicit type annotations on variables to clearly document the code and/or to make TypeScript protected against accidental changes to the variable’s type. We’ll see in later chapters how explicit type annotations can sometimes explicitly tell TypeScript information it wouldn’t have inferred normally.

Type Shapes
TypeScript does more than check that the values assigned to variables match their original types. TypeScript also knows what member properties should exist on objects. If you attempt to access a property of a variable, TypeScript will make sure that property is known to exist on that variable’s type.

Suppose we declare a rapper variable of type string. Later on, when we use that rapper variable, operations that TypeScript knows work on strings are allowed:

let rapper = "Queen Latifah";
rapper.length; // ok

Operations that TypeScript doesn’t know to work on strings will not be allowed:

rapper.push('!');
//     ~~~~
// Property 'push' does not exist on type 'string'.

Types can also be more complex shapes, most notably objects. In the following snippet, TypeScript knows the cher object doesn’t have a middleName key and complains:

let cher = {
  firstName: "Cherilyn",
  lastName: "Sarkisian",
};

cher.middleName;
//   ~~~~~~~~~~
//   Property 'middleName' does not exist on type
//   '{ firstName: string; lastName: string; }'.

TypeScript’s understanding of object shapes allows it to report issues with the usage of objects, not just assignability. Chapter 4, “Objects” will describe more of TypeScript’s powerful features around objects and object types.
Modules

The JavaScript programming language did not include a specification for how files can share code between each other until relatively recently in its history. ECMAScript 2015 added “ECMAScript modules,” or ESM, to standardize import and export syntax between files.

For reference, this module file imports a value from a sibling ./values file and exports a doubled variable:

import { value } from "./values";

export const doubled = value * 2;

To match with the ECMAScript specification, in this book I’ll use the following nomenclature:

Module
    A file with a top-level export or import
Script
    Any file that is not a module

TypeScript is able to work with those modern module files as well as older files. Anything declared in a module file will be available only in that file unless an explicit export statement in that file exports it. A variable declared in one module with the same name as a variable declared in another file won’t be considered a naming conflict (unless one file imports the other file’s variable).

The following a.ts and b.ts files are both modules that export a similarly named shared variable without issue. c.ts causes a type error because it has a naming conflict between an imported shared and its own value:

// a.ts
export const shared = "Cher";

// b.ts
export const shared = "Cher";

// c.ts
import { shared } from "./a";
//       ~~~~~~
// Error: Import declaration conflicts with local declaration of 'shared'.

export const shared = "Cher";
//           ~~~~~~
// Error: Individual declarations in merged declaration
// 'shared' must be all exported or all local.

If a file is a script, though, TypeScript will consider it to be globally scoped, meaning all scripts have access to its contents. That means variables declared in a script file cannot have the same name as variables declared in other script files.

The following a.ts and b.ts files are considered scripts because they do not have module-style export or import statements. That means their variables of the same name conflict with each other as if they were declared in the same file:

// a.ts
const shared = "Cher";
//    ~~~~~~
// Cannot redeclare block-scoped variable 'shared'.

// b.ts
const shared = "Cher";
//    ~~~~~~
// Cannot redeclare block-scoped variable 'shared'.

If you see these “Cannot redeclare…​” errors in a TypeScript file, it may be because you have yet to add an export or import statement to the file. Per the ECMAScript specification, if you need a file to be a module without an export or import statement, you can add an export {}; somewhere in the file to force it to be a module:

// a.ts and b.ts
const shared = "Cher"; // Ok

export {};

Warning
TypeScript will not recognize the types of imports and exports in TypeScript files written using older module systems such as CommonJS. TypeScript will generally see values returned from CommonJS-style require functions to be typed as any.

    Why did the number and string break up?
    They weren’t each other’s types.
