Chapter 1. From JavaScript to TypeScript
    JavaScript today
    Supports browsers decades past
    Beauty of the web
Before talking about TypeScript, we need to first understand where it came from: JavaScript!

History of JavaScript
JavaScript was designed in 10 days by Brendan Eich at Netscape in 1995 to be approachable and easy to use for websites. Developers have been poking fun at its quirks and perceived shortcomings ever since. I’ll cover some of them in the next section.

JavaScript has evolved tremendously since 1995, though! Its steering committee, TC39, has released new versions of ECMAScript—the language specification that JavaScript is based on—yearly since 2015 with new features that bring it in line with other modern languages. Impressively, even with regular new language versions, JavaScript has managed to maintain backward compatibility for decades in varying environments, including browsers, embedded applications, and server runtimes.

Today, JavaScript is a wonderfully flexible language with a lot of strengths. One should appreciate that while JavaScript has its quirks, it’s also helped enable the incredible growth of web applications and the internet.
    Show me the perfect programming language and I’ll show you a language with no users.
    -Anders Hejlsberg, TSConf 2019

Vanilla JavaScript’s Pitfalls
Developers often refer to using JavaScript without any significant language extensions or frameworks as “vanilla”: referring to it being the familiar, original flavor. I’ll soon go over why TypeScript adds just the right flavor to overcome these particular major pitfalls, but it’s useful to understand just why they can be painful. All these weaknesses become more pronounced the larger and longer-lived a project gets.

Costly Freedom
Many developers’ biggest gripe with JavaScript is unfortunately one of its key features: JavaScript provides virtually no restrictions in how you structure your code. That freedom makes it a ton of fun to start a project in JavaScript!

As you get to have more and more files, though, it becomes apparent how that freedom can be damaging. Take the following snippet, presented out of context from some fictional painting application:

function paintPainting(painter, painting) {
  return painter
    .prepare()
    .paint(painting, painter.ownMaterials)
    .finish();
}

Reading that code without any context, you can only have vague ideas on how to call the paintPainting function. Perhaps if you’ve worked in the surrounding codebase you may recall that painter should be what’s returned by some getPainter function. You might even make a lucky guess that painting is a string.

Even if those assumptions are correct, though, later changes to the code may invalidate them. Perhaps painting is changed from a string to some other data type, or maybe one or more of the painter’s methods are renamed.

Other languages might refuse to let you run code if their compiler determines it would likely crash. Not so with dynamically typed languages—those that run code without checking if it will likely crash first—such as JavaScript.

The freedom of code that makes JavaScript so fun becomes a real pain when you want safety in running your code.

Loose Documentation
Nothing exists in the JavaScript language specification to formalize describing what function parameters, function returns, variables, or other constructs in code are meant to be. Many developers have adopted a standard called JSDoc to describe functions and variables using block comments. The JSDoc standard describes how you might write documentation comments placed directly above constructs such as functions and variables, formatted in a standard way. Here’s an example, again taken out of context:

/**
 * Performs a painter painting a particular painting.
 *
 * @param {Painter} painter
 * @param {string} painting
 * @returns {boolean} Whether the painter painted the painting.
 */
function paintPainting(painter, painting) { /* ... */ }

JSDoc has key issues that often make it unpleasant to use in a large codebase:
    Nothing stops JSDoc descriptions from being wrong about code.
    Even if your JSDoc descriptions were previously correct, during code refactors it can be difficult to find all the now-invalid JSDoc comments related to your changes.
    Describing complex objects is unwieldy and verbose, requiring multiple standalone comments to define types and their relationships.

Maintaining JSDoc comments across a dozen files doesn’t take up too much time, but across hundreds or even thousands of constantly updating files can be a real chore.

Weaker Developer Tooling
Because JavaScript doesn’t provide built-in ways to identify types, and code easily diverges from JSDoc comments, it can be difficult to automate large changes to or gain insights about a codebase. JavaScript developers are often surprised to see features in typed languages such as C# and Java that allow developers to perform class member renamings or jump to the place an argument’s type was declared.

Note
You may protest that modern IDEs such as VS Code do provide some development tools such as automated refactors to JavaScript. True, but: they use TypeScript or an equivalent under the hood for many of their JavaScript features, and those development tools are not as reliable or as powerful in most JavaScript code as they are in well-defined TypeScript code.

TypeScript!
TypeScript was created internally at Microsoft in the early 2010s then released and open sourced in 2012. The head of its development is Anders Hejlsberg, notable for also having lead the development of the popular C# and Turbo Pascal languages. TypeScript is often described as a “superset of JavaScript” or “JavaScript with types.” But what is TypeScript?

TypeScript is four things:
Programming language
    A language that includes all the existing JavaScript syntax, plus new TypeScript-specific syntax for defining and using types
Type checker
    A program that takes in a set of files written in JavaScript and/or TypeScript, develops an understanding of all the constructs (variables, functions…​) created, and lets you know if it thinks anything is set up incorrectly
Compiler
    A program that runs the type checker, reports any issues, then outputs the equivalent JavaScript code
Language service
    A program that uses the type checker to tell editors such as VS Code how to provide helpful utilities to developers

Getting Started in the TypeScript Playground
You’ve read a good amount about TypeScript by now. Let’s get you writing it!

The main TypeScript website includes a “Playground” editor at https://www.typescriptlang.org/play. You can type code into the main editor and see many of the same editor suggestions you would see when working with TypeScript locally in a full IDE (Integrated Development Environment).

Most of the snippets in this book are intentionally small and self-contained enough that you could type them out in the Playground and tinker with them for fun.

TypeScript in Action
Take a look at this code snippet:

const firstName = "Georgia";
const nameLength = firstName.length();
//                           ~~~~~~
// This expression is not callable.

The code is written in normal JavaScript syntax—I haven’t introduced TypeScript-specific syntax yet. If you were to run the TypeScript type checker on this code, it would use its knowledge that the length property of a string is a number — not a function — to give you the complaint shown in the comment.

If you were to paste that code into the playground or an editor, it would be told by the language service to give you a little red squiggly under length indicating TypeScript’s displeasure with your code. Hovering over the squigglied code would give you the text of the complaint (Figure 1-1).

TypeScript reporting the 'length' property of a firstName string is not callable.

Being told of these simple errors in your editor as you type them is a lot more pleasant than waiting until a particular line of code happens to be run and throw an error. If you tried to run that code in JavaScript, it would crash!

Freedom Through Restriction
TypeScript allows us to specify what types of values may be provided for parameters and variables. Some developers find having to explicitly write out in your code how particular areas are supposed to work to be restrictive at first.

But! I would argue that being “restricted” in this way is actually a good thing! By restricting our code to only being able to be used in the ways you specify, TypeScript can give you confidence that changes in one area of code won’t break other areas of code that use it.

If, say, you change the number of required parameters for a function, TypeScript will let you know if you forget to update a place that calls the function.

In the following example, sayMyName was changed from taking in two parameters to taking one parameter, but the call to it with two strings wasn’t updated and so is triggering a TypeScript complaint:

// Previously: sayMyName(firstName, lastName) { ...
function sayMyName(fullName) {
  console.log(`You acting kind of shady, ain't callin' me ${fullName}`);
}

sayMyName("Beyoncé", "Knowles");
//                   ~~~~~~~~~
// Expected 1 argument, but got 2.

That code would run without crashing in JavaScript, but its output would be different from expected (it wouldn’t include "Knowles"):

You acting kind of shady, ain't callin' me Beyoncé

Calling functions with the wrong number of arguments is exactly the sort of short-sighted JavaScript freedom that TypeScript restricts.

Precise Documentation
Let’s look at a TypeScript-ified version of the paintPainting function from earlier. Although I haven’t yet gone over the specifics of TypeScript syntax for documenting types, the following snippet still hints at the great precision with which TypeScript can document code:

interface Painter {
  finish(): boolean;
  ownMaterials: Material[];
  paint(painting: string, materials: Material[]): boolean;
}

function paintPainting(painter: Painter, painting: string): boolean { /* ... */ }

A TypeScript developer reading this code for the first time could understand that painter has at least three properties, two of which are methods. By baking in syntax to describe the “shapes” of objects, TypeScript provides an excellent, enforced system for describing how objects look.

Stronger Developer Tooling
TypeScript’s typings allow editors such as VS Code to gain much deeper insights into your code. They can then use those insights to surface intelligent suggestions as you type. These suggestions can be incredibly useful for development.

If you’ve used VS Code to write JavaScript before, you might have noticed that it suggests “autocompletions” as you write code with built-in types of objects like strings. If, say, you start typing the member of something known to be a string, TypeScript can suggest all the members of the strings (Figure 1-2).
TypeScript suggesting a dropdown of properties starting with 'se' as members of a string.

When you add TypeScript’s type checker for understanding code, it can give you these useful suggestions even for code you’ve written. Upon typing painter. in the paintPainting function, TypeScript would take its knowledge that the painter parameter is of type Painter and the Painter type has the following members.
TypeScript suggesting a dropdown of properties starting with 'se' as members of a string.

Snazzy! I’ll cover a plethora of other useful editor features in Chapter 12, “Using IDE Features”.

Compiling Syntax
TypeScript’s compiler allows us to input TypeScript syntax, have it type checked, and get the equivalent JavaScript emitted. As a convenience, the compiler may also take modern JavaScript syntax and compile it down into its older ECMAScript equivalents.

If you were to paste this TypeScript code into the Playground:

const artist = "Augusta Savage";
console.log({ artist });

The Playground would show you on the right-hand side of the screen that this would be the equivalent JavaScript output by the compiler.

TypeScript Playground compiling TypeScript code into equivalent JavaScript.

The TypeScript Playground is a great tool for showing how source TypeScript becomes output JavaScript.

Note
Many JavaScript projects use dedicated transpilers such as Babel (https://babeljs.io) instead of TypeScript’s own to transpile source code into runnable JavaScript. You can find a list of common project starters on https://learningtypescript.com/starters.

Getting Started Locally
You can run TypeScript on your computer as long as you have Node.js installed. To install the latest version of TypeScript globally, run the following command:

npm i -g typescript

Now, you’ll be able to run TypeScript on the command line with the tsc (TypeScript Compiler) command. Try it with the --version flag to make sure it’s set up properly:

tsc --version

It should print out something like Version X.Y.Z—whichever version is current as of you installing TypeScript:

$ tsc --version
Version 4.7.2

Running Locally

Now that TypeScript is installed, let’s have you set up a folder locally to run TypeScript on code. Create a folder somewhere on your computer and run this command to create a new tsconfig.json configuration file:

tsc --init

A tsconfig.json file declares the settings that TypeScript uses when analyzing your code. Most of the options in that file aren’t going to be relevant to you in this book (there are a lot of uncommon edge cases in programming that the language needs to account for!). I’ll cover them in Chapter 13, “Configuration Options”. The important feature is that now you can run tsc to tell TypeScript to compile all the files in that folder and TypeScript will refer to that tsconfig.json for any configuration options.

Try adding a file named index.ts with the following contents:

console.blub("Nothing is worth more than laughter.");

Then, run tsc and provide it the name of that index.ts file:

tsc index.ts

You should get an error that looks roughly like:

index.ts:1:9 - error TS2339: Property 'blub' does not exist on type 'Console'.

1 console.blub("Nothing is worth more than laughter.");
          ~~~~

Found 1 error.

Indeed, blub does not exist on the console. What was I thinking?

Before you fix the code to appease TypeScript, note that tsc created an index.js for you with contents including the console.blub.

Note
This is an important concept: even though there was a type error in our code, the syntax was still completely valid. The TypeScript compiler will still produce JavaScript from an input file regardless of any type errors.

Correct the code in index.ts to call console.log and run tsc again. There should be no complaints in your terminal, and the index.js file should now contain updated output code:

console.log("Nothing is worth more than laughter.");

Tip
I highly recommend playing with the book’s snippets as you read through them, either in the playground or in an editor with TypeScript support, meaning it runs the TypeScript language service for you. Small self-contained exercises, as well as larger projects, are also available to help you practice what you’ve learned on https://learningtypescript.com.

Editor Features

Another benefit of creating a tsconfig.json file is that when editors are opened to a particular folder, they will now recognize that folder as a TypeScript project. For example, if you open VS Code in a folder, the settings it uses to analyze your TypeScript code will respect whatever’s in that folder’s tsconfig.json.

As an exercise, go back through the code snippets in this chapter and type them in your editor. You should see drop-downs suggesting completions for names as you type them, especially for members such as the log on console.

Very exciting: you’re using the TypeScript language service to help yourself write code! You’re on your way to being a TypeScript developer!

Tip
VS Code comes with great TypeScript support and is itself built in TypeScript. You don’t have to use it for TypeScript—virtually all modern editors have excellent TypeScript support either built-in or available via plugins—but I do recommend it for at least trying out TypeScript while reading through this book. If you do use a different editor, I also recommend enabling its TypeScript support. I’ll cover editor features more deeply in Chapter 12, “Using IDE Features”.

What TypeScript Is Not
Now that you’ve seen how wonderful TypeScript is, I have to warn you about some limitations. Every tool excels at some areas and has limitations in others.

A Remedy for Bad Code
TypeScript helps you structure your JavaScript, but other than enforcing type safety, it doesn’t enforce any opinions on what that structure should look like.

Good!

TypeScript is a language that everyone is meant to be able to use, not an opinionated framework with a target audience. You can write code using whatever architectural patterns you’re used to from JavaScript, and TypeScript will support them.

If anybody tries to tell you that TypeScript forces you to use classes, or makes it hard to write good code, or whatever code style complaints are out there, give them a stern look and tell them to pick up a copy of Learning TypeScript. TypeScript does not enforce code style opinions such as whether to use classes or functions, nor is it associated with any particular application framework—Angular, React, etc.—over others.

Extensions to JavaScript (Mostly)
TypeScript’s design goals explicitly state that it should:
    Align with current and future ECMAScript proposals
    Preserve runtime behavior of all JavaScript code

TypeScript does not try to change how JavaScript works at all. Its creators have tried very hard to avoid adding new code features that would add to or conflict with JavaScript. Such a task is the domain of TC39, the technical committee that works on ECMAScript itself.

There are a few older features in TypeScript that were added many years ago to reflect common use cases in JavaScript code. Most of those features are either relatively uncommon or have fallen out of favor, and are only covered briefly in Chapter 14, “Syntax Extensions”. I recommend staying away from them in most cases.

Note
As of 2022, TC39 is investigating adding a syntax for type annotations to JavaScript. The latest proposals have them acting as a form of comments that do not impact code at runtime and are used only for development-time systems such as TypeScript. It will be many years until type comments or some equivalent are added to JavaScript, so they won’t be mentioned elsewhere in this book.

Slower Than JavaScript
Sometimes on the internet, you might hear some opinionated developers complain that TypeScript is slower than JavaScript at runtime. That claim is generally inaccurate and misleading. The only changes TypeScript makes to code are if you ask it to compile your code down to earlier versions of JavaScript to support older runtime environments such as Internet Explorer 11. Many production frameworks don’t use TypeScript’s compiler at all, instead using a separate tool for transpilation (the part of compiling that converts source code from one programming language into another) and TypeScript only for type checking.

TypeScript does, however, add some time to building your code. TypeScript code must be compiled down to JavaScript before most environments, such as browsers and Node.js, will run it. Most build pipelines are generally set up so that the performance hit is negligible, and slower TypeScript features such as analyzing code for likely mistakes are done separately from generating runnable application code files.

Note
Even projects that seemingly allow running TypeScript code directly, such as ts-node and Deno, themselves internally convert TypeScript code to JavaScript before running it.

Finished Evolving
The web is nowhere near finished evolving, and thus neither is TypeScript. The TypeScript language is constantly receiving bug fixes and feature additions to match the ever-shifting needs of the web community. The basic tenets of TypeScript you’ll learn in this book will remain about the same, but error messages, fancier features, and editor integrations will improve over time.

In fact, while this edition of the book was published with TypeScript version 4.7.2 as the latest, by the time you started reading it, we can be certain a newer version has been released. Some of the TypeScript error messages in this book might even already be out of date!
