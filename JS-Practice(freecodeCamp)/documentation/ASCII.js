// ASCII, the charCodeAt() Method and the fromCharCode() Method

/*
ASCII: ASCII, short for American Standard Code for Information Interchange, is a character encoding standard used in computers to represent text. 
It assigns a numeric value to each character, which is universally recognized by machines.
The charCodeAt() Method: This method is called on a string and returns the ASCII code of the character at a specified index.
*/

const letter = "A";
console.log(letter.charCodeAt(0));  // 65

// The fromCharCode() Method: This method converts an ASCII code into its corresponding character.

const char = String.fromCharCode(65);
console.log(char);  // A
