Memory Management

Definition: Memory management is the process of controlling the memory, allocating it when needed and freeing it up when it's no longer needed. 
JavaScript uses automatic memory management. This means that JavaScript (more specifically, the JavaScript engine in your web browser) takes care of memory allocation and deallocation for you. 
You don't have to explicitly free up memory in your code. 
This automatic process is often called "garbage collection."
