Data Types in JavaScript

Data types help the program understand the kind of data it's working with, whether it's a number, text, or something else.

    Number: A number represents both integers and floating-point values. Examples of integers include 7, 19, and 90.
    Floating point: A floating point number is a number with a decimal point. Examples include 3.14, 0.5, and 0.0001.
    String: A string is a sequence of characters, or text, enclosed in quotes. "I like coding" and 'JavaScript is fun' are examples of strings.
    Boolean: A boolean represents one of two possible values: true or false. You can use a boolean to represent a condition, such as isLoggedIn = true.
    Undefined and Null: An undefined value is a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value. A null value is an empty value or a variable that has intentionally been assigned a value of null.
    Object: An object is a collection of key-value pairs. The key is the property name, and the value is the property value.
