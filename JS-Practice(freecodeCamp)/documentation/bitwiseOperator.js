/*
Bitwise Operators

Bitwise AND (&) Operator: This operator returns a 1 in each bit position for which the corresponding bits of both operands are 1.
Bitwise AND Assignment (&=) Operator: This operator performs a bitwise AND operation with the specified number and reassigns the result to the variable.
Bitwise OR (|) Operator: This operator returns a 1 in each bit position for which the corresponding bits of either or both operands are 1.
Bitwise OR Assignment (|=) Operator: This operator performs a bitwise OR operation with the specified number and reassigns the result to the variable.
Bitwise XOR (^) Operator: This operator returns a 1 in each bit position for which the corresponding bits of either, but not both, operands are 1.
Bitwise NOT (~) Operator: This operator inverts the binary representation of a number.
Left Shift (<<) Operator: This operator shifts all bits to the left by a specified number of positions.
Right Shift (>>) Operator: This operator shifts all bits to the right.
