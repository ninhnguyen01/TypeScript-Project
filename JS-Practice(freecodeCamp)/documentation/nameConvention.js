/*
Variable Naming Conventions

    Variable names should be descriptive and meaningful.
    Variable names should be camelCase like cityName, isLoggedIn, and veryBigNumber.
    Variable names should not start with a number. They must begin with a letter, _, or $.
    Variable names should not contain spaces or special characters, except for _ and $.
    Variable names should not be reserved keywords.
    Variable names are case-sensitive. age and Age are different variables.
