JavaScript Functions

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task.
Functions can be defined using the function keyword followed by a name, a list of parameters, and a block of code that performs the task.
Arguments are values passed to a function when it is called.
When a function finishes its execution, it will always return a value.
By default, the return value of a function is undefined.
The return keyword is used to specify the value to be returned from the function and ends the function execution.

Arrow Functions

Arrow functions are a more concise way to write functions in JavaScript.
Arrow functions are defined using the => syntax between the parameters and the function body.
When defining an arrow function, you do not need the function keyword.
If you are using a single parameter, you can omit the parentheses around the parameter list.
If the function body consists of a single expression, you can omit the curly braces and the return keyword.
