/*
Scope in Programming

Global scope: This is the outermost scope in JavaScript. Variables declared in the global scope are accessible from anywhere in the code and are called global variables.
Local scope: This refers to variables declared within a function. These variables are only accessible within the function where they are declared and are called local variables.
Block scope: A block is a set of statements enclosed in curly braces {} such as in if statements, or loops.
Block scoping with let and const provides even finer control over variable accessibility, helping to prevent errors and make your code more predictable.
