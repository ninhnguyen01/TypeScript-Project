// JavaScript as a Dynamically Typed Language

/* 
JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, which means that you don't have to specify the data type of a variable when you declare it. 
The JavaScript engine automatically determines the data type based on the value assigned to the variable.
*/

let error = 404; // JavaScript treats error as a number
error = "Not Found"; // JavaScript now treats error as a string
