// Semicolons in JavaScript

/* 
Semicolons are primarily used to mark the end of a statement. 
This helps the JavaScript engine understand the separation of individual instructions, which is crucial for correct execution.
*/

let message = 'Hello, World!'; // first statement ends here
let number = 42; // second statement starts here

// Semicolons help prevent ambiguities in code execution and ensure that statements are correctly terminated.
